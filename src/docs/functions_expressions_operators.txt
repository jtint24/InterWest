Functions, expressions, operators

What is their relation to one another?

Plan 1:

Functions wrap expressions. They also keep a function type. The function keeps track of its parameter pattern,
and is responsible for putting all of the arguments into memory before running an expression and returning
the value. Functions also handle type checking

In order to run a function, you need the following:
    - The state to run the function in
    - A list of values that constitute the arguments
