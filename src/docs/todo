Things to do:

    - [ ] Lexer
        - [ ] Revise identifier definition to be actual (accept a-Z, 0-9 after first char, and _)
    - [ ] Parser
        - [ ] Add Pratt parsing / parse binary operators
    - [x] Add test suite
        - [x] Build testing module
    - [ ] Minor fixes
        - [x] Change all methods that return/accept subclasses of Collection to return as general a subclass as possible (ie. ArrayList<> -> List<>)
        - [ ] Make test interpreter its own thing that inherits from Interpreter, rather than just having it be a boolean value
        - [ ] Make the parser read token-by-token from the lexer, rather than having it require all the lexemes at once
