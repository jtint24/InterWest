Problems with ASTs:


- How do we connect return statements to returnable scopes? This is easy if the return statement is on the top level
 of a returnable scope, but it's much harder if a returnable scope contains a nonreturnable scope which contains a return
    - Maybe ExpressionResult gets a new parameter if it's an early return, and nonreturnable scopes, upon receiving that,
      quit immediately, but returnable scopes process it as a return? That works for me.
- How to validate AST?
    - There needs to be some kind of "validation context" that helps things like VariableExpressions know their types
        by seeing what values they're referencing without actually executing the code
    - We need to validate types, but also basic structural things, like making sure that you can't exit a function
        without returning, maybe make some warnings about unreachable code.
    - Maybe don't give expressions their own errormanagers, just have them return errors and concatenate them, then have
        the interpretation session report them all at once. That allows for reporting of multiple errors
