let tryThis = {Int i -> Int
    return unit // Comment on this line
}
let tryThis = {Int i -> i}

EXPECTED_RESULT:
[X] TYPE MISMATCH --------------------------------------------------------- A000

2 | return unit // Comment on this line
  |        ^^^^
  |        |
  |        This has type `Unit`


I was expecting an expression of type `Int` but here we're returning a value of `Unit`.


[X] REDECLARED CONSTANT --------------------------------------------------- A000

4 | let tryThis = {Int i -> i}
  |     ^^^^^^^
  |     |
  |     This constant exists in scope


This constant, `tryThis`, already exists and can't be redeclared.
