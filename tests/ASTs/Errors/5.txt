EXPECTED_RESULT:
[X] TYPE MISMATCH --------------------------------------------------------- A000

1 | if 1{
  |    ^
  |    |
  |    This has type `Int`


The condition of this if statement has type `Int`, which doesn't match what I expected, type `Bool`.


[X] NOT RETURNABLE -------------------------------------------------------- A000

2 | return unit
  | ^^^^^^
  | |
  | This statement can't return


I don't actually see any scope for this statement to return from.

help: Make sure that this return statement is in a function
[X] TYPE MISMATCH --------------------------------------------------------- A000

5 | if (a) {
  |     ^
  |     |
  |     This has type `Unit`


The condition of this if statement has type `Unit`, which doesn't match what I expected, type `Bool`.


[X] UNKNOWN CONSTANT ------------------------------------------------------ A000

8 | let c = b
  |         ^
  |         |
  |         I don't recognize this


I can't find a constant called `b` in scope.
