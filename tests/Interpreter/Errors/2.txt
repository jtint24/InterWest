let a = 5
let b = let a = b

EXPECTED_RESULT:
[X] UNKNOWN CONSTANT ------------------------------------------------------ A000

let b = let a = b
                ^
                |
                I don't recognize this


I can't find a constant called `b` in scope.


[X] REDECLARED CONSTANT --------------------------------------------------- A000

let b = let a = b
            ^
            |
            This constant exists in scope


This constant, `a`, already exists and can't be redeclared.
